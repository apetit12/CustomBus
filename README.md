# CustomBus

These files are about customized bus service design.

Customized bus service provides advanced, personalized, and flexible demand responsive public transit with almost door-to-door service without transfers.

It makes use of density-based algorithm DBSCAN to cluster users with similar trip origin/destination and travel time.
Once the clusters have been determined, K-means clustering is used to determine the optimal location of the bus stops.
